    <h1>LET THE HEART BEAT</h1> <p>is a website where it is a platform where one can help each other in letting their heart beat through donations.<br>
    Each and every person in the world dont have enough money to let their heart getting treated. So, as  humans, it is our responsibility to help each other in the form of donations.<br>
A small amount of donation from each person can let the heart beat. So, as an influencer, I have created a platform, where we all can help each other with donation and, this amount shall go to different Heart-related Trusts& Hospitals to let the hearts beat!! </p>
